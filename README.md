# Apache Superset Integration with NPCYF

### Overview
This project focuses on integrating **Apache Superset** with **NPCYF** to enable robust data visualization capabilities. Apache Superset serves as a powerful and flexible platform for creating interactive dashboards and visual analytics for the NPCYF framework and also includes docker configurations for setting up Apache Superset and MySQL Server, along with role-based access control and embedded dashboards.

### Key Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Embedding Apache Superset dashboards within the NPCYF environment.
- **Data Visualization**: Advanced charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards to represent complex datasets.
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets and provides optimized visualizations for better insights.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified access to analytics for non-technical users.
